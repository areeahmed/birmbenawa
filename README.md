## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

I've learned a lot, learned how to create a mobile app and what it consists of, and how to connect it to Firebes, connect screens, and transfer data from one screen to another.

when I used the IconPicker plugin from the package there was an error inside the plugin I asked in Stack Overflow and they told me the solution that was solved 6 months ago.
