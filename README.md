## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

I've learned a lot, learned how to create a mobile app and what it consists of, and how to connect it to Firebes, connect screens, and transfer data from one screen to another.

when I used the IconPicker plugin from the package there was an error inside the plugin I asked in Stack Overflow and they told me the solution that was solved 6 months ago.

I was faced an Error Said ( Box not found. Did you forget to call Hive.openBox()? ) and this Error Fixed : because i was closed the box some where in some of the class so i deleted the closs box segment code and it had been fixed.

after using Hive when we restart our application or when we run our program the program was give an error
( Box not found. Did you forget to call Hive.openBox()? ), so i fixed this after i opened box's above run app, to this issus was because of opening box's after running app.

the package MSHCheckBoxButton has and bug, and it was the value won't be reinitialized.

changing the place of days of the daily screen it will make the program not working because mon == 1 and it means
monday is the first day and so on.
